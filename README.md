# Data Structures
This repository contains the different Data Structures there are and demonstrates the Linear Data Structures and Non-Linear Data Structures. The Data Structures that were used in all the different files here were Lists, Dictionaries, Linked Lists, Queues, Stacks, Binary Trees, and Graphs. Each file uses a different Data Structure and the program does something accordingly to the Data Structure used.
## Linear Data Structures
Lists, Dictionaries, Linked Lists, Queues, and Stacks are the Linear Data Structures used here. Some of them are Built in and some are User Defined.
### Built in
The 2 Data Structures that are used here that are built into python are Lists and Dictionaries.
#### Dictionary.py
The Dictionary Data Structure is used in this file.
#### List.py
A list is the most used of all the Data Structure and this file makes use of it.
### User Defined
Linked Lists, Queues, and Stacks are user defined Data Structures.
#### LinkedList.py
The LinkedList Data Structure is implemented in this file.
#### Queue.py
The Queue Data Structure is used in this code.
#### Stack.py
This file makes use of the Stack Data Structure.
## Non-Linear Data Structures
Binary Trees and Graphs are examples of Non-Linear Data Structures and that are used here.
### Binary Tree
This folder contains 2 files which are ConstraintCheck.py and InOrderTraversal.py which make use of the Binary Tree Data Structure.
#### ConstraintCheck.py

#### InOrderTraversal.py

### Graph.py
This code makes use of the Graph Data Structure.
